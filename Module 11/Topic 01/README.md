# “What is a Stock?**

1. A **stock** represents a unit of ownership in a company, giving the holder a claim on a portion of the company’s assets and profits.
2. When you buy a stock, you become a **shareholder**, meaning you own a fraction of the business—no matter how small.
3. Owning stock does *not* mean you own chairs, buildings, or computers of the company; instead, you own a **financial claim** proportional to your shares.
4. Companies issue stocks to raise capital, and investors buy stocks to benefit from growth and profit-sharing.
5. A publicly traded company can have **millions or billions of shares**, each representing a tiny slice of ownership.
6. Stocks are also called **equities** because they represent equity ownership in a firm.
7. When a company earns profit, shareholders indirectly benefit through **capital appreciation** (stock price increase).
8. Shareholders may also receive **dividends**, which are periodic profit distributions paid out by some companies.
9. Stock ownership gives you certain **rights**, such as voting in shareholder meetings, depending on the type of share.
10. Large shareholders or “promoters” can influence company decisions because they hold a significant percentage of shares.
11. Stocks are bought and sold on **stock exchanges** such as NSE, BSE, NYSE, and NASDAQ.
12. The stock’s price is determined by *market forces*—mainly supply and demand among buyers and sellers.
13. A stock’s value fluctuates due to company performance, economic conditions, global events, and investor sentiment.
14. Stocks are managed electronically today, and ownership is recorded in a **demat account**, replacing old paper certificates.
15. A stock can have different categories such as **common stock** and **preferred stock**, offering different rights.
16. Common stock usually comes with **voting rights**, while preferred stockholders often get **priority dividends**.
17. Companies sell shares to raise money for growth, expansion, research, debt repayment, or acquisitions.
18. Investors buy stocks to generate wealth by participating in the company’s success over time.
19. Stock investing is one of the most effective long-term methods of building wealth and beating inflation.
20. Stocks are volatile, meaning their price can rise or fall quickly due to market conditions.
21. Holding a stock means you are exposed to both **risk** (loss of money) and **reward** (profit potential).
22. A company’s total value represented by all its shares is called **market capitalization** (“market cap”).
23. Stocks are classified by market cap: **large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap**, each with different risk levels.
24. Large-cap stocks are generally stable, while small-cap stocks can give higher returns but carry higher risk.
25. Every stock has a **ticker symbol**, a short code used for trading (e.g., RELIANCE, AAPL, TSLA).
26. Buying stock means believing the company will grow, innovate, and increase its earnings over time.
27. Stocks can be held for minutes (trading), days (swing trading), months (position trading), or years (investing).

29. Traders often use **technical analysis** to predict short-term price movements.
30. The value of a stock reflects the company’s future earning potential and current investor expectations.
31. Stock ownership can include **dividend income**, which provides cash flow in addition to price appreciation.
32. Dividends are announced during quarterly earnings and distributed to shareholders on record.
33. Stock prices rise when more investors want to buy than sell, creating **buying pressure**.
34. Prices fall when sellers outnumber buyers, creating **selling pressure**.
35. Government regulations, especially from authorities like **SEBI**, ensure fair and transparent trading practices.
36. Stocks can be traded only during market hours, which vary by country.
37. Stocks are considered high-risk, high-reward assets because their value is highly sensitive to news and events.
38. Stock ownership does not guarantee returns; companies can fail, causing stocks to lose value.
39. Some stocks are growth-oriented, reinvesting profits rather than paying dividends.
40. Other stocks are income-oriented, providing regular dividends.
41. Stocks are key components of mutual funds, ETFs, index funds, hedge funds, and retirement portfolios.
42. Long-term stock investors rely heavily on the power of **compounding**, where returns generate more returns.
43. Short-term traders rely on volatility, looking to profit from quick price movements.
44. Stock prices also react to global factors like interest rates, inflation, GDP data, and geopolitical events.
45. Companies report financial performance every quarter, and these reports influence stock prices.
