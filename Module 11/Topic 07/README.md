# ⭐ How Price of a Stock is Decided

1. The price of a stock is essentially determined by the **forces of demand and supply** in the market.
2. When more investors want to buy a stock than sell it, the price rises.
3. Conversely, if more investors want to sell than buy, the price falls.
4. In the primary market, the company sets an IPO price, but in the secondary market, the price is dynamic.
5. Investors’ perception of a company’s future earnings plays a crucial role in price movement.
6. Strong quarterly results often attract more buyers, pushing the price higher.
7. Weak financial performance or losses create selling pressure, reducing the stock price.
8. Macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates affect stock valuations.
9. When the economy is growing, businesses earn more, and stock prices generally rise.
10. High inflation or rising interest rates can lower stock prices as borrowing costs increase.
11. Global events, such as geopolitical tensions or global market crashes, impact stock prices.
12. Market sentiment, which reflects the collective attitude of investors, often drives short-term prices.
13. Positive news like product launches, mergers, or acquisitions boosts investor confidence.

15. Technical analysis studies historical price and volume data to predict future movements.
16. Analysts use support and resistance levels to anticipate price reversals or breakouts.
17. Moving averages, RSI, MACD, and other indicators also guide traders in decision-making.

19. If the market price is below intrinsic value, investors consider it undervalued and buy.
20. If the market price is above intrinsic value, it may be overvalued, prompting selling.
21. Large institutional investors significantly influence stock prices due to the volume they trade.
22. Retail investors collectively can also create trends through coordinated buying or selling.
23. Market makers provide liquidity by continuously quoting buy and sell prices.
24. The bid price is what buyers are willing to pay; the ask price is what sellers demand.
25. The difference between bid and ask prices is called the **spread**, which affects trading costs.
26. Algorithmic and high-frequency trading can cause rapid fluctuations in stock prices.
27. Corporate actions such as bonus issues, splits, or dividends affect stock pricing.
28. A bonus issue increases the number of shares but reduces the market price proportionally.

30. Dividends impact investor perception and the effective price of holding a stock.
31. Companies with strong brand value and competitive advantage often trade at premium valuations.
32. Stocks with higher perceived risk usually trade at lower valuations to compensate investors.
