# ⭐ IPO – What Happens Step by Step (50 Long, Detailed Lines)**

1. An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is the process where a private company decides to become a publicly listed company for the first time.
2. The company begins the IPO journey by internally evaluating its financial strength, growth plans, and the need for raising external capital.
3. Management then discusses with investment bankers to determine whether the market conditions are favorable for an IPO.
4. Investment bankers act as intermediaries who help the company structure and execute the IPO efficiently.
5. The company appoints a lead manager or book-running lead manager (BRLM) to handle the entire IPO process.
6. The lead manager conducts a thorough study of the company’s business, finances, risks, and future potential.
7. This information is compiled into a document called the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP).
8. The DRHP contains every detail about the company that investors need to make an informed decision.
9. The DRHP is then submitted to SEBI, the market regulator, for approval.
10. SEBI reviews the document to ensure transparency, accuracy, and investor protection.
11. During this review, SEBI may ask for clarifications or additional information from the company.
12. Once SEBI approves the DRHP, it becomes the final Red Herring Prospectus (RHP).
13. The RHP is made public so that investors can study the company before applying for shares.
14. The company then decides the IPO dates, price band, and total number of shares to be offered.
15. The price band is a range within which investors can bid for the shares.
16. In a book-building IPO, investors choose a price within the band and place their bids accordingly.
17. Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs), and Retail Investors all participate in the bidding.
18. Demand from these categories determines the final IPO price.
19. If demand is high, the price tends to settle at the upper end of the band.
20. If demand is average, the price may settle closer to the lower band.
21. Retail investors usually apply through apps like Zerodha, Upstox, or banking ASBA.
22. ASBA ensures that your application amount is blocked but not deducted until allotment.
23. Once the bidding period ends, the subscription status is analyzed.
24. If the IPO is oversubscribed, shares are allotted through a lottery system.
25. Oversubscription means more people applied than the number of shares available.
26. In such cases, not everyone receives shares; only a small percentage of applicants get allotment.
27. If the IPO is undersubscribed, the company may reduce the offer size or extend the issue period.
28. After allotment is finalized, the shares are credited to investors’ demat accounts.
29. Investors who did not receive allotment get their blocked funds unblocked automatically.
30. Once allotment is complete, the company is ready for listing on the stock exchange.
31. Listing means the company’s shares start trading on platforms like NSE and BSE.
32. The listing day is extremely important because the opening price reflects market sentiment.
33. If demand is high, stocks may open at a premium—higher than the IPO price.
34. A premium listing gives investors instant profit, known as listing gain.
35. If sentiment is weak, the stock may list at a discount—lower than the IPO price.
36. Listing price is determined by pre-market trades that happen before the market opens.
37. After listing, the stock trades freely based on supply and demand.
38. From this point onward, all transactions happen in the secondary market.
39. The company does not receive any money from secondary market trades.
40. IPO funds collected earlier are now part of the company’s capital.
41. The company uses these funds for business expansion, marketing, technology upgrades, or debt reduction.
42. Investors can now track the stock’s performance through charts, financial results, and news.
43. The company must follow strict disclosure rules after listing to ensure transparency.
44. Quarterly results, shareholding patterns, and corporate announcements must be reported regularly.
45. Investors watch these disclosures to understand whether the company is performing as promised.
46. IPO success depends on the company’s fundamentals and market conditions.
47. Good companies with strong growth plans generally see strong demand and positive listing.
48. Weak companies or overpriced IPOs may perform poorly after listing.
49. IPOs are considered high-interest events because they attract retail and institutional investors simultaneously.
50. In summary, an IPO transforms a private company into a public enterprise, connects investors with opportunities, and fuels economic growth.
